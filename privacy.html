      <p> - OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS. </p>
      <p> Feel Frolic has vendors to us provide the Services. These vendors process your data only at and according to Feel Frolic´s instructions to provide the Service, and perform tasks such as hosting, player support, advertising, analytics and fraud prevention. </p>
      <p> - Other companies and public authorities. </p>

      <p> These partners may access data regarding your activities and your device (such as your IP address, mobile identifiers, page(s) visited, location, time of day).

      <p> INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS </p>

      <p> We and our partners collect and store information about users' interactions with unaffiliated websites and applications that use our technologies, including cookies and similar tracking technologies.
